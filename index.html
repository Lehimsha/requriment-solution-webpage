      <h3>What is online recruitment?</h3>
      <p>Online recruitment (also known as E-recruitment or internet recruiting) allows businesses to use various internet-based solutions – for example, online advertising, job listings, social media and company websites to source and hire the best candidates.</p>
      <p>The prolific use of the internet for recruiting has made it easier to source candidates and conduct interviews as well as process the relevant paperwork required to hire and train candidates. Online recruitment is a way to provide businesses with an efficient and cheaper way to fill positions.</p>
      <h2>In short, the advantages of online recruitment include:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>
        "Providing your company with a competitive edge."
        </p>
        <p>
        "Online recruitment provides your hiring team with a better        applicant pool."
        </p>  
        <p>
        "Online recruitment saves time and money by using automation and AI to screen applicants."
        </p>
        <p>
        "Automation from online recruiting can also be used to communicate with a large number of applicants at one time."
        </p>
      <h3>Advanced Candidate Search</h3>
      <p>Find the perfect candidates for your job roles using our powerful search functionality.</p>
    <h2>Using candidate sourcing tools</h2>
    <p>EXPAND OUTREACH TO A LARGER AUDIENCE: The more recruiting channels you use to search for candidates, the more chances you’ve got to identify good potential hires and build diverse teams.</p>
    <p>REDUCE TIME-TO-HIRE: Create a pool of potential candidates, by proactively researching and engaging with qualified people. This way, when there’s an open role that matches their profile, you can contact them directly to learn if they’re interested. They are more likely to want to hear about your open role if you have already established a connection and they’re familiar with your company.</p>
    <P>RECRUIT FOR HARD TO FILL ROLES: If you’re hiring for various roles, you know that some positions attract more applicants than others. When you’re facing a shortage in job applications, you can actively source candidates – in professional networks or using Boolean search strings – to target audiences with your desired skill set.

      <P>The only way you will ever achieve seamless collaboration is by having transparent project tracking between your team and the client. This helps to make sure your entire team is on the same page and each person is handling his or her tasks accordingly, in order to stay on track.</P>
